The goal of this project is to develop an Android application that allows users to record their daily activities. The app will feature a main page for real-time activity tracking, logging the various activities performed throughout the day. On the same page, the user will also be able to view activity logs from the previous two days. The design supports both real-time and retrospective logging, enabling users to choose the frequency of notifications based on their daily routines. This flexibility makes the app suitable for both personal use and for researchers or organizations conducting time-use studies.

<summary>üñ•Ô∏è <strong>Recommended Development Environment</strong></summary>

To ensure smooth setup and compatibility, the project is intended to be run as follows:

The recommended development setup is:
- **Windows** as the **host OS** (running the frontend)
- A **Ubuntu Linux virtual machine** (e.g., via **VMware**) as the **backend environment**

> [!Important]  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è The backend has **not been tested on WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Its compatibility is currently unknown, so it is **not recommended** to use WSL2 for backend development.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Clone the repository into a shared folder (Linux VM <-> Windows)</strong></summary>

   To ensure seamless collaboration between the **frontend (Windows)** and **backend (Linux VM)**, it's recommended to clone the repository into a **shared folder** that both systems can access (e.g., VMWare shared folder or a mounted network drive).

   This allows the Windows-hosted frontend and the Linux-hosted backend to work with the same source code base.

   ```bash
   # From inside your Linux virtual machine:
   cd /path/to/shared/folder
   git clone https://github.com/bonoboprog/Chronogram.git
   ```
</details>



---
<details>
<summary>üîê <strong>Environment Variables (.env)</strong></summary>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure all `.env` files are saved with LF (Unix-style) line endings ‚Äî especially after each edit.**  
> On Windows, you can switch from `CRLF` to `LF` in the bottom-right corner of editors like VS Code.  
> This prevents parsing issues in Docker, Node, and other tools.


The project uses two environment configuration files that look like these:



### 1. Root `.env` (Backend Configuration)
Located in the project root folder:

```env
# Database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=chronogram
MYSQL_USER=chronouser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_db_password
# API Keys
LLM_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
# Email
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
# Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
APP_CANONICAL_URL=http://localhost:8100
```

### 2. Front `.env` (Frontend Configuration)

Located in /frontend folder

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok-free.app/chronogram
```

üîÅ This value must match the public URL generated by ngrok.
üëâSee [Start an endpoint](#1-install-ngrok-on-linux-and-start-a-tunnel) for details on how to obtain it.

<summary>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Setting Up a Development Environment</strong></summary>

## 0. **Backend Environment Setup (on Ubuntu)**

These are required globally on your Ubuntu system before launching the app in the frontend on Windows.


‚òï Java 11+

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

# Verify Java version
java -version
```
---

üì¶ Maven

```bash
sudo apt install maven

# Verify Maven version
mvn -v
```

---

üê≥ Docker (using Docker's official apt repository)

 üîÅ Preliminaries ‚Äì Remove conflicting packages
Run the following command to uninstall all conflicting packages with Docker Engine:

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```
 
> `apt-get` might report that you have none of these packages installed.
        

üß∑ Add Docker's official GPG key and repository

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

üì• Install the latest version, run:


```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

‚úÖ Verify that the installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

 ```bash
 sudo docker run hello-world
 ```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container.
When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

üéâ You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine.

## 1. **Install ngrok on Linux and start a tunnel**

Install ngrok via Apt with the following command:


```bash
curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
&& echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install ngrok
```

Add your authtoken (If you don‚Äôt have an authtoken then [Sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) for a free account).

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN>
```
   
Start an endpoint:

```bash
ngrok http 80
```


> üîó Copy the URL generated by ngrok (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok-free.app) and paste it into the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable inside the frontend .env file.



## 2. **Start backend environment on Linux**

First, move into the cloned `Chronogram` repository folder, then navigate to the backend scripts directory and run the setup script:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/Chronogram/scripts/backend_scripts
./setup_fresh_backend.sh
```
This script will:

- Stop and remove old containers
- Build the backend (`build.sh`)
- Start MySQL and Tomcat and Nginx

## 3. **Refresh backend after making code changes**

   ```bash
   ./refresh_tomcat_server.sh
   ```

## 4. **Set up the LLM with your API key üîë**

   1. Go to [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
   2. Click **Sign In** in the top-right corner and log in (you can use GitHub, Google, etc.)
   3. Go to the [API Keys Dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   4. Click **"Create new key"**
   5. Copy your newly generated key
   6. Paste it into your `.env` file as follows:

      ```env
      LLM_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
      ```


## 5. **Frontend Environment Setup (on Windows)**

   This section sets up the frontend development environment on **Windows**, including Node.js via `fnm` (Fast Node Manager) and the Ionic CLI.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è The frontend must be developed on **Windows**, and Node.js should be installed using `fnm`, as recommended by the official Node.js documentation for Windows.

   ````powershell
   # --- Install fnm (Fast Node Manager) ---
   # Open PowerShell and run the following
   
   # Download and install fnm:
   winget install Schniz.fnm
   
   # Download and install Node.js:
   fnm install 22

   # Verify the Node.js version:
   node -v # Should print "v22.14.0".

   # Verify npm version:
   npm -v # Should print "10.9.2".

   # --- Install Ionic CLI globally ---
   npm install -g @ionic/cli

   # Verify Ionic version
   ionic -v
   ````



## 6. **Launch the app frontend in Windows**

   Open a terminal window ‚Äî preferably the **integrated terminal** of your favorite IDE ‚Äî and navigate to the `frontend/` folder located in the project root. Then run:

   ```bash
   ionic build
   ionic serve
   ```
   



## 7. **Connect to MySQL container from Windows (e.g., using MySQL Workbench)**

   If you want to inspect or manage the backend MySQL database from **Windows**, you can connect to the running MySQL container using tools like **MySQL Workbench**.

   The MySQL container exposes the **default MySQL port 3306** to the host, making it accessible from Windows as long as the Docker host is reachable (e.g., if running on a local Linux VM with bridged or host networking).

   #### ‚úÖ Steps:

   1. Open **MySQL Workbench** on Windows.
   2. Create a **new connection** with the following settings:
      - **Hostname**: IP address or hostname of the Linux VM (e.g., `192.168.x.x`)
      - **Port**: `3306`
      - **Username**: use the `MYSQL_USER` defined in the backend `.env` file
      - **Password**: use the corresponding `MYSQL_PASSWORD` (check "Store in Vault‚Ä¶" if desired)
   3. Test the connection and save.

   > üí° You can find the database name in the `.env` file under `MYSQL_DATABASE`.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the container is up and that the port `3306` is properly published in `docker-compose.yml`, e.g.:
   > ```yaml
   > ports:
   >   - "3306:3306"
   > ```

   > üîê Ensure no firewall or network rule is blocking the connection between Windows and the Linux host.
